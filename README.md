## Pros and Cons of TDD
The advantage of using TDD is that it saves time in the long run. With a functioning test file, the programmers will be able to test their website demos quickly without having to generate a new address on the console. Because one will be writing smaller tests, it will force the program to be more modular which will make it easier to debug. Consequently, it makes the code unit testable, after being modularized. This will make it easier to divide the tasks amongst teammates and allow team members to edit each others code without having to worry that their changes may affect the entire project. Most importantly, by doing TDD, the programmer is forcing themselves to write unit tests for various components of the website, which helps them to truly understand their code.
The disadvantage of using TDD is such that it can be very cumbersome. From my experience from lab 6, it took me hours to figure out how to run a simple test case for my website. Although there are various sources online, different developers use different techniques on various types of applications, so it is very difficult to find documentation which teaches exactly what I want. Since the tests need to be ran on the console, requires various libraries, and modifications to JSON files, the program might lose time trying to learn the mechanisms of TDD. It is especially cumbersome because TDD alone involves debugging, which may not be ideal for a programmer who has a strict deadline. Therefore, although it may seem beneficial to modularize the code via TDD, it can slow down development and introduce new challenges.
